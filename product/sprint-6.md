### Database Schema

```sql
-- Goal categories
CREATE TABLE goal_categories (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID, -- NULL for system-defined categories
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  color VARCHAR(7) DEFAULT '#007bff', -- Hex color
  is_system_defined BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, name)
);

-- Insert system-defined categories
INSERT INTO goal_categories (name, description, is_system_defined) VALUES
('Career', 'Professional development and work-related goals', true),
('Health', 'Physical and mental health objectives', true),
('Finances', 'Financial planning and money management goals', true),
('Personal Development', 'Learning, skills, and personal growth', true),
('Relationships', 'Family, friends, and social connections', true),
('Hobbies', 'Leisure activities and personal interests', true);

-- Goals table
CREATE TABLE goals (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  category_id UUID REFERENCES goal_categories(id),
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,

  -- SMART criteria fields
  specific_details TEXT, -- What exactly will be accomplished?
  measurable_criteria TEXT, -- How will progress be measured?
  achievable_plan TEXT, -- How is this goal attainable?
  relevant_why TEXT, -- Why is this goal important?
  time_bound_date DATE, -- When will this be completed?

  priority VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'Medium' CHECK (priority IN ('High', 'Medium', 'Low')),
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Active' CHECK (status IN ('Active', 'Completed', 'Paused', 'Archived')),

  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP,

  UNIQUE(user_id, title)
);

-- Milestones table
CREATE TABLE milestones (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  goal_id UUID REFERENCES goals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  target_date DATE,
  is_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP,
  order_index INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_goals_user_id ON goals(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_goals_category ON goals(category_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_goals_status ON goals(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_milestones_goal_id ON milestones(goal_id);
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /goals` - List all goals with filtering options
- `POST /goals` - Create new goal with SMART validation
- `GET /goals/:id` - Get specific goal with milestones
- `PUT /goals/:id` - Update goal
- `DELETE /goals/:id` - Delete/archive goal
- `POST /goals/:id/milestones` - Add milestone to goal
- `PUT /milestones/:id` - Update milestone
- `DELETE /milestones/:id` - Delete milestone
- `GET /goal-categories` - Get available categories
- `POST /goal-categories` - Create custom category
- `GET /goals/progress-summary` - Get overall progress summary

### SMART Validation Service

- [ ] Specific validation (clear, well-defined)
- [ ] Measurable validation (quantifiable metrics)
- [ ] Achievable validation (realistic assessment)
- [ ] Relevant validation (aligned with values)
- [ ] Time-bound validation (specific deadline)

## üìä Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] SMART goal creation wizard functional
- [ ] Milestone system tracks progress accurately
- [ ] Life categories organize goals effectively
- [ ] Validation provides helpful feedback
- [ ] Progress calculations are correct
- [ ] Database migrations completed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (min 80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved

## üîç Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: SMART validation logic, progress calculations, milestone ordering
- **Integration Tests**: Goal CRUD operations, milestone management
- **Manual Tests**: Goal creation wizard, category filtering, progress tracking
- **Edge Cases**: Leap years, past dates, long-term goals (5+ years)

## üìà Success Metrics

- Users create well-formed SMART goals (80%+ pass validation)
- Average goal has 3-5 milestones
- Goal completion rate improves with milestone tracking
- Users actively use life categories for organization
- API response times under 300ms

## üöÄ Sprint Retrospective Questions

1. How effective is the SMART goal creation wizard?
2. Are users finding the milestone system helpful for tracking progress?
3. What additional life categories are users requesting?
4. How can we improve goal validation and guidance?
