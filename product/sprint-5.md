### Database Schema Updates

```sql
-- Update habit_checkins table
ALTER TABLE habit_checkins ADD COLUMN notes TEXT;
ALTER TABLE habit_checkins ADD COLUMN mood INTEGER CHECK (mood BETWEEN 1 AND 5);
ALTER TABLE habit_checkins ADD COLUMN energy_before INTEGER CHECK (energy_before BETWEEN 1 AND 5);
ALTER TABLE habit_checkins ADD COLUMN energy_after INTEGER CHECK (energy_after BETWEEN 1 AND 5);
ALTER TABLE habit_checkins ADD COLUMN context_tags TEXT[]; -- location, social, etc.

-- Achievements table
CREATE TABLE achievements (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'streak', 'consistency', 'milestone'
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  criteria JSONB, -- flexible criteria storage
  badge_icon VARCHAR(100),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- User achievements
CREATE TABLE user_achievements (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  habit_id UUID REFERENCES habits(id),
  achievement_id UUID REFERENCES achievements(id),
  earned_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  streak_count INTEGER, -- for streak achievements
  UNIQUE(user_id, habit_id, achievement_id)
);

-- Habit reminders
CREATE TABLE habit_reminders (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  habit_id UUID REFERENCES habits(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  reminder_time TIME NOT NULL,
  days_of_week INTEGER[], -- which days to remind
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  message TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Progress snapshots (for analytics)
CREATE TABLE habit_progress_snapshots (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  habit_id UUID REFERENCES habits(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  snapshot_date DATE NOT NULL,
  completion_rate DECIMAL(5,2), -- percentage
  current_streak INTEGER,
  total_completions INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(habit_id, snapshot_date)
);
```

### New API Endpoints

- `GET /habits/:id/analytics` - Get habit analytics and trends
- `GET /habits/:id/streak` - Enhanced streak information
- `GET /habits/:id/journal` - Get habit journal entries
- `PUT /habit-checkins/:id` - Update check-in with notes/mood
- `GET /achievements` - Get available achievements
- `GET /users/:id/achievements` - Get user's earned achievements
- `POST /habits/:id/reminders` - Set habit reminders
- `GET /habits/progress-summary` - Get weekly/monthly progress summary

### Background Services

- [ ] Daily progress snapshot generation
- [ ] Achievement evaluation service
- [ ] Reminder notification service
- [ ] Weekly progress report generation

## üìä Definition of Done
