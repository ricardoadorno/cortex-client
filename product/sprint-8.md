# Sprint 8: Integration & The Productivity Pyramid üî∫

**Duration:** 3 weeks  
**Sprint Goal:** Implement the complete productivity pyramid by establishing seamless relationships between Tasks, Habits, and Goals, creating a unified system where every action contributes to long-term success.

## üìã User Stories

### Task-Habit Promotion System

- **As a user**, I want to promote recurring tasks to habits so that I can get better tracking and gamification
- **As a user**, I want suggestions for task-to-habit promotion so that I can identify patterns
- **As a user**, I want to see which tasks could become habits so that I can build better routines
- **As a user**, I want seamless data migration when promoting tasks so that I don't lose history

### Task-Goal Relationships

- **As a user**, I want to link tasks to specific goals so that I can see how daily actions contribute to long-term objectives
- **As a user**, I want to link tasks to goal milestones so that I can break down big objectives into actionable steps
- **As a user**, I want to see goal progress from task completion so that I feel motivated by the connection
- **As a user**, I want to create tasks directly from goals so that I can immediately act on my objectives

### Habit-Goal Integration

- **As a user**, I want to link habits to goals so that I can see how consistent behaviors drive long-term success
- **As a user**, I want to see goal progress from habit consistency so that I understand the compound effect
- **As a user**, I want habit suggestions based on my goals so that I can build relevant routines
- **As a user**, I want to see how habit streaks contribute to goal achievement so that I stay motivated

### Productivity Pyramid Visualization

- **As a user**, I want to see the productivity pyramid so that I can understand how my actions connect
- **As a user**, I want to see my progress across all levels so that I can maintain balance
- **As a user**, I want insights about my productivity system so that I can optimize my approach
- **As a user**, I want to navigate between connected items so that I can see the full picture

### Database Schema for Relationships

```sql
-- Task-Goal relationships

  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  task_id UUID REFERENCES tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  goal_id UUID REFERENCES goals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  milestone_id UUID REFERENCES milestones(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  contribution_weight DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 1.0, -- How much this task contributes
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(task_id, goal_id)
);

-- Habit-Goal relationships
CREATE TABLE habit_goal_relationships (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  habit_id UUID REFERENCES habits(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  goal_id UUID REFERENCES goals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  contribution_weight DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 1.0,
  target_consistency DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 0.8, -- 80% consistency expected
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(habit_id, goal_id)
);

-- Task-Habit promotion tracking
CREATE TABLE task_habit_promotions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  original_task_id UUID REFERENCES tasks(id),
  new_habit_id UUID REFERENCES habits(id),
  promotion_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  historical_completions INTEGER,
  notes TEXT
);

-- Productivity insights
CREATE TABLE productivity_insights (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  insight_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'connection_suggestion', 'pyramid_balance', 'orphaned_item'
  title VARCHAR(255),
  description TEXT,
  suggested_action TEXT,
  data JSONB, -- Insight-specific data
  priority INTEGER DEFAULT 1, -- 1=high, 2=medium, 3=low
  is_dismissed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Goal progress contributors (unified tracking)
CREATE TABLE goal_progress_contributors (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  goal_id UUID REFERENCES goals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  contributor_type VARCHAR(20), -- 'task', 'habit', 'milestone'
  contributor_id UUID, -- Generic reference
  contribution_date DATE,
  progress_delta DECIMAL(5,2), -- How much progress this contributed
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
