  milestone_id UUID REFERENCES milestones(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  depends_on_milestone_id UUID REFERENCES milestones(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(milestone_id, depends_on_milestone_id)
);

-- Goal templates
CREATE TABLE goal_templates (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID, -- NULL for system templates
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  category_id UUID REFERENCES goal_categories(id),
  template_data JSONB, -- Store goal structure as JSON
  is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  usage_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Progress snapshots for analytics
CREATE TABLE goal_progress_snapshots (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  goal_id UUID REFERENCES goals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  snapshot_date DATE NOT NULL,
  progress_percentage DECIMAL(5,2),
  milestones_completed INTEGER,
  total_milestones INTEGER,
  days_elapsed INTEGER,
  predicted_completion_date DATE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(goal_id, snapshot_date)
);

-- Goal insights
CREATE TABLE goal_insights (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  insight_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'trend', 'recommendation', 'achievement'
  title VARCHAR(255),
  description TEXT,
  data JSONB, -- Additional insight data
  is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  generated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
